# HDLBits Learning Repository

This repository contains my solutions and practice exercises from [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/), an interactive platform for learning Verilog and SystemVerilog hardware description language.

## Repository Structure

- **Getting started/** - Introductory exercises to learn basic Verilog concepts
  - Output Zero - First simple exercises
  - Step_one - Building foundational skills

- **Verilog Language/** - Core language features and constructs
  - Basics/ - Fundamental gates, wires, and simple circuits (AND, NOR, XNOR gates, etc.)
  - Vectors/ - Working with multi-bit signals, concatenation, replication, and vector operations

- **Modules/** - Modular design exercises
  - Hierarchical module instantiation and module parameter usage

- **Procedures/** - Sequential and conditional logic
  - Always blocks and conditional statements (if/else)

## Purpose

This repository documents my progress through HDLBits exercises, serving as both a learning record and a reference for Verilog design patterns and best practices.

## Running the Exercises

Each `.v` file contains Verilog code corresponding to a specific HDLBits problem. These files can be tested and simulated using Verilog simulators like:
- ModelSim
- Vivado
- Icarus Verilog
- Online simulators on HDLBits
