add4 is a structural model (also called a gate-level or hierarchical structural model).

It's built by instantiating four instances of the add module and cascading them together:
Each add module is composed of sum and carry submodules

The carry output from one adder feeds into the carry input of the next
This creates a ripple-carry adder architecture

Explicitly instantiates and connects lower-level modules, which is characteristic of structural design.
