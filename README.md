# Verilog

This repository contains a personal collection of Verilog examples, exercises, and small projects that I use for studying and experimenting with digital design concepts. It is organized by topic and reflects the files I have saved while working through HDLbits material and my own notes.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The top level of the repository includes one primary `README.md` and two major folders:

- `adder4_structural/` – A small structural implementation of a 4‑bit adder with supporting files and a testbench.
- `HDLbits/` – A large collection of exercises and example code organized according to the HDLbits online course structure. Subdirectories include:
  - `Getting started/`
  - `Verilog Language/` with subfolders for Basics, Modules, Procedures, Vectors, More Verilog Features, etc.
  - `Circuits/Combinational Logic/Basic Gates/` – individual gate examples and simple circuits.
  - `Structutal/` – multiplexer examples and versions.
  - `Truth table/` – sample problems with designs and testbenches.

> 💡 **Note:** The full directory tree can be explored with `tree /f` on Windows or `find . -print` on Unix systems.

## 📝 Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   - A Verilog simulator such as [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/), ModelSim, or any tool that accepts `.v` source files.
   - Basic familiarity with command‑line usage.

2. **Running a Example**
   ```sh
   # from the repository root
   cd HDLbits/Verilog\ Language/Basics
   iverilog -o and_gate_tb and_gate.v && vvp and_gate_tb
   ```
   Adjust paths and filenames according to the example you want to simulate.

3. **Viewing Waveforms**
   Use a waveform viewer such as GTKWave:
   ```sh
   gtkwave dump.vcd
   ```
   where `dump.vcd` is generated by your testbench.

## 📚 How the Contents are Organized

- **Tutorial-style folders** (`Getting started`, `Verilog Language`) mirror HDLbits sections and contain progressively more complex code as you advance through the material.
- **Exercise files** are typically named with the exercise number (e.g. `ex1_wire.v`, `ex7_Module_fadd.v`).
- **Structural designs** (in `adder4_structural` and `Structutal/` subfolders) demonstrate module instantiation and hierarchy.
- **Testbenches**: Many directories include `tb.v` or `testbench.v` files illustrating how to verify the corresponding design.

## 🙌 Contributing

This is a personal workspace; I may add new examples or reorganize content as I continue learning. The structure is simply how I chose to save files while practicing.

## 📄 License

The repository reflects personal notes and code. There is no specific license or intention for reuse by others.
